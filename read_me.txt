Hello,The Super Hero Trailer website is composed of 3 files. The first is the entertainment_center.py file, which stores the list of movies, titles, trailers, and posters. You can add or subtract movies in this file.The second is the media.py file, which makes the selection of what details we are storing about the movie. For example, if we wanted to add the director of the movie, we would add the director class to the media.py file, then the director names to our entertainment_center.py file. Last is the fresh_tomatoes.py file, which is where we can make changes to the appearance and html for the structure of the site.Thank you,Nate
